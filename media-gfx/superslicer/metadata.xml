		A PrusaSlicer fork (which is a slic3r fork) (previously Slic3r++)

		SuperSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code instructions for FFF printers or PNG
		layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain which is
		running a firmware based on Marlin, Prusa, Klipper, etc.

		SuperSlicer is based on PrusaSlicer by Prusa Research. PrusaSlicer is based on Slic3r by Alessandro Ranellucci
		and the RepRap community.
